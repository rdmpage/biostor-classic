Sakai Laboratory of Crustacea, Shikoku Women\'s University, 771-11 Tokushima, Ohjincho-Furukawa , Japan L. B. Holthuis Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historic, Post bus 9517, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands Abstract. The purpose of this application is the conservation of the name Callianidea H. Milne Edwards. 1 837 for a cosmopolitan mud shrimp genus. It is threatened by Isea Guerin-Meneville, 1 832. not used as a valid name since its inception because it was long regarded as a homonym of an older name, Isaea (an amphipod genus). 1. The name Isaea H. Milne Edwards, 1830 (p. 380) was first established for an amphipod genus with the single included species Isaea montagui Milne Edwards, 1830. 2. In 1832, Guerin-Meneville (p. 299) proposed the name Isea for a monotypic decapod genus containing the new species Isea elongata. 3. H. Milne Edwards (1837, p. 321) considered Isaea and Isea to be homonyms, and replaced the latter by the name Callianisea. In the same paper Milne Edwards described the new genus Callianidea with the single included species typa, and remarked under Callianisea that Guerin\'s material was in very poor condition and that therefore the supposed differences between Callianidea and Callianisea might prove to be non-existent. Later authors have shared this view and synonymised the two genera. 4. The first author to do this was Guerin-Meneville himself ( 1 856, p. xviii), who cited ■Callianidea.-Edw., Crust.. II, 319 (1837).— Sin. Isea Guer. Ann. Sac. ent., t. I, p. 30 ( 1 832) - Callianisea, Edw., Crust., II, 32 1 ( 1 837)\'. The name Callianidea was preferred over Callianisea by Guerin-Meneville and all later authors, probably because (1) it had \'page priority\' (being mentioned 2 pages earlier), and (2) Callianidea was based on complete material while the type material of Callianisea was in a very poor condition when described, so there was doubt about the identity of the species. GuerinMeneville\'s (1856) action was that of the first reviser (Art. 24) and it fixed the precedence oi Callianidea over Callianisea, the two names having been published on the same date. 5. A further replacement name for Isea Guerin-Meneville, 1832 was proposed by Dana (1852, p. 11), who suggested the name Callisea because Callianisea \'is so near Callianassa and Callianidea. a contraction to Callisea would be preferable\'. Neither Callianisea nor Callisea found acceptance by zoologists. ';

Poore Department of Crustacea, Museum of Victoria, Swanston Street, Melbourne, Victoria 3000, Australia Abstract. The purpose of this appHcation is to conserve the accustomed usage of the specific names of two South African species of prawns: Upogebia capensis (Krauss, 1843) and U. africana (Ortmann, 1894). The latter species is commonly known as the mud-prawn or mud-shrimp. It is proposed to designate a replacement neotype for capensis from material of the species as presently understood; the previously designated neotype is a specimen of africana. 1. Three species of Gebia Leach, 1815 (p. 342; family upogebiidae) were described from South Africa. Gebia major var. capensis Krauss, 1843 (p. 54) was originally described as a variety of Gebia major de Haan, [1841] (pi. 35, fig. 7; text (p. 165) published in [ 1 849]; see Sherborn & Jentink ( 1 895, p. 1 50) and Holthuis ( 1 953. p. 37) for the dates of publication). The type material from Table Bay is now lost. The original description was short and by modern standards very incomplete and cannot be definitely reconciled with any single species known today. G. subspinosa Stimpson, 1860 (p. 22) was described from Simon\'s Bay; the fate of its type material is unknown. G. africana Ortmann, 1894 (p. 22, pi. 2. fig. 4) was described from Port Elizabeth. The holotype of this species is in the Zoological Museum, Strasbourg; it is a male without its abdomen (cephalothorax length 19.5 mm). Although in rather poor condition, it still shows the main characteristics of the species. 2 . Since 1 9 1 all three species have been referred to the genus Upogebia Leach, [1814] (pp. 386, 400; see Rathbun, 1897, p. 154, footnote for the date of publication). Until 1947 there was confusion between the three taxa and usually only one nominal species, U. capensis, was recognised (see, for example, Stebbing, 1900. p. 45; Stebbing. 1910; Balss, 1916, p. 34; Lenz & Strunck, 1914. p. 291; de Man, 1927, pp. 32 34; de Man. 1928, pp. 37, 41, 51). Barnard (1947, pp. 380, 381 ; 1950. pp. 514^520. fig. 96) revised the South African species of Upogebia and concluded that two species were involved: U. capensis (Krauss), characterised by a subdistal spine on the upper border of the merus of pereopod 1 and coxal spines on pereopods 1-3. and U. africana (Ortmann).';
